This is your project's root directory. Along with housing our application, it
also is the home to many of our tools' configuration files.

The following files reside in this folder:

    -> .gitignore (a git configuration file)
      The gitignore file specifies which files to not include in a git repository.
      Files included are often system files, temporary files, and other files which
      are specific to a machine.

    -> .rvmrc (a rvm configuration file)
      A project rvmrc file (a rvmrc file in the root folder of a project directory)
      specifies a ruby environment.

      Ruby Version Manager, or RVM, helps install and manage multiple versions of
      ruby, different interpreters, and sets of gems.

    -> Gemfile (a list of gems) && Gemfile.lock (a bundler-generated file)
      A Gemfile is a list of dependencies (gems) of your project. Use Bundler to
      install and manage rubygems.

      To install your gems, run `bundle install`.

      Gemfile.lock is a bundler-generated list of gems with versions. This is
      generated and versioned to keep a consistent environment across machines.
      It will be created and updated when you install gems with bundler.

      Rake (Ruby Make) is a tool used to run ruby code.

      environment files in config/environment and our rails application.
