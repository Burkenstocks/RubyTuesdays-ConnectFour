The /config folder is home to Rack and Rails configuration.

Most of the configuration you see here is what Rails auto-generates when you
create a new rails project. These files consist of environment configs, rack
initializers, among other things.


The most notable files and folders are:

    -> application.rb
      This file is a rails configuration file for all environments.


    -> environments/
      This folder contains rails configuration files for different environments. If
      anything is both defined in one of these files and application.rb, the
      environment config file will override the configuration in application.rb


    -> routes.rb (rails routes file)
      The routes file declares the URL paths with controller actions.
