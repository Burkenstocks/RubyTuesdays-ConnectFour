The /db folder contains database-related files.

    -> migrate/
      Migrations are used to modify the structure of your database and keep
      multiple users' database structure the same. To run migrations on your
      local database and test database, call:

        bundle exec rake db:migrate       # run migrations on development db
        bundle exec rake db:test:prepare  # copy the dev schema to your test db

      To learn more about the structure of migrations, see the rails guides:
        - http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html

    -> schema.rb
      This is an autogenerated file which keeps a record of the current
      database schema.
