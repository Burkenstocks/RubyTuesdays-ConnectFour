The spec folder is home to all of our application's tests.

As you may notice, our /spec folder closely mimics the structure of the /app
folder. Nearly every file in the /app folder should have a separate unit test
and corresponding spec file.

The non-spec files are the following:

    -> /factories (factory girl modal declaration)
      Contains files corresponding to models often used in specs.

        FactoryGirl
          - http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl#readme

    -> spec_helper.rb
      The spec_helper file is home to spec helpers, require statements, and spec
      configuration. It is common practice to include spec_helper.rb at the top of
      each spec file.
